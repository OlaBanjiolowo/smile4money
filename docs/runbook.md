## 1. Emergency Contract Pause

**When to use:** Suspected exploit, incorrect payout, oracle compromise, or any situation where
halting new activity is safer than continuing operations.

**Who can pause:** Only the `admin` address set during `initialize`.

**Effect:** Blocks `create_match`, `deposit`, and `submit_result`. `cancel_match` remains
available so players can always recover their funds.

### Steps

#### 1.1 Confirm the admin identity

```bash
# Verify your local key matches the on-chain admin
stellar keys address admin-key
# Compare output against the CONTRACT_ADMIN value in your .env
```

#### 1.2 Pause the escrow contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- pause
```

For **mainnet**, replace `--network testnet` with `--network mainnet`.

#### 1.3 Verify the pause is in effect

```bash
# This call should return an error: Error::ContractPaused (code 9)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source any-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_match \
  --player1 GDUMMY1 \
  --player2 GDUMMY2 \
  --stake_amount 1 \
  --token GDUMMY3 \
  --game_id test \
  --platform '{"Lichess":{}}'
# Expected output: error code 9 (ContractPaused)
```

Alternatively, query the `Paused` instance storage key using Stellar's RPC:

```bash
curl -s "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,
    "method":"getLedgerEntries",
    "params":{"keys":["<PAUSED_LEDGER_KEY_XDR>"]}
  }'
```

#### 1.4 Notify the team

Post to the incident channel immediately:

```
[INCIDENT] Escrow contract PAUSED at ledger <N> by <admin-address>.
Reason: <brief description>
Next action: <investigation / drain / oracle rotation>
```

---

## 2. Oracle Signing Key Rotation

**When to use:** Oracle private key is compromised, exposed in logs, or as a scheduled rotation.

**Who can rotate:** Only the `admin` address.

### Steps

#### 2.1 Generate a new oracle keypair

```bash
stellar keys generate new-oracle-key --network testnet
stellar keys address new-oracle-key
# Save the output address as NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS
```

For mainnet, **generate the keypair offline** on an air-gapped machine and import the public
address only:

```bash
# On air-gapped machine
stellar keys generate new-oracle-key
stellar keys address new-oracle-key   # copy this address

# On connected machine — fund the new account
stellar account fund --address <NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS> --network testnet
```

#### 2.2 Fund the new oracle account (testnet)

```bash
stellar account fund --address "$NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS" --network testnet
```

#### 2.3 Call `update_oracle` on the escrow contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- update_oracle \
  --new_oracle "$NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS"
```

#### 2.4 Call `transfer_admin` on the oracle contract

The oracle **contract** also has its own admin (the off-chain service key). Rotate it too:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ORACLE" \
  --source old-oracle-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- transfer_admin \
  --new_admin "$NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS"
```

#### 2.5 Verify the new oracle is registered

```bash
# Submit a test result with the new key (use a safe test match_id on testnet)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ORACLE" \
  --source new-oracle-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- submit_result \
  --match_id 0 \
  --game_id "rotation-verify-test" \
  --result '{"Player1Wins":{}}'
```

Expected: success (or `AlreadySubmitted` if a result already exists — both confirm auth works).

#### 2.6 Update the oracle service configuration

```bash
# In the oracle service deployment (e.g., systemd, Docker, or cloud secret store):
# Replace ORACLE_SIGNING_KEY with the new key
# Restart the oracle service and confirm it re-connects successfully
systemctl restart smile4money-oracle   # or equivalent
journalctl -u smile4money-oracle -f    # watch for errors
```

#### 2.7 Revoke and destroy the old key

- Remove the old key from all `.env` files and secret stores.
- If using a hardware wallet, revoke the signing slot.
- Document the rotation in the incident log.

---

## 3. Oracle Key Compromise Response

**When to use:** You have confirmed or strongly suspect the oracle signing key has been leaked,
stolen, or otherwise compromised (e.g. key found in logs, repo, or environment variable leak).

> ⚠️ **Treat this as a Critical incident.** A compromised oracle key means an attacker can
> fabricate match results and drain escrow funds for any active match.

**Who can respond:** Admin keyholder (for pause and `update_oracle`), oracle service owner (for
auditing events and key destruction).

### Steps

#### 3.1 Pause the escrow contract immediately

Do this **first**, before any investigation. Every second the contract is unpaused, an attacker
with the oracle key can call `submit_result` and steal funds.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- pause
```

Verify the pause is in effect (see [§1.3](#13-verify-the-pause-is-in-effect)).

Post to the incident channel:

```
[CRITICAL INCIDENT] Oracle key suspected compromised. Escrow PAUSED at ledger <N>.
Auditing submit_result events. Do NOT unpause until new oracle key is confirmed.
```

#### 3.2 Call `update_oracle` with a new safe address

Generate a fresh oracle keypair on a clean machine (air-gapped for mainnet):

```bash
# Generate new keypair
stellar keys generate new-oracle-key --network testnet
stellar keys address new-oracle-key
# Save the output as NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS
```

Register the new key on the escrow contract:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- update_oracle \
  --new_oracle "$NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS"
```

Also rotate the oracle contract's own admin (see [§2.4](#24-call-transfer_admin-on-the-oracle-contract)).

The old key is now rejected by the escrow contract even if the attacker still holds it.

#### 3.3 Audit all `submit_result` events since the compromise date

Identify the earliest ledger at which the key could have been compromised, then query all
`submit_result` events from that ledger forward:

```bash
# Query the Stellar RPC for contract events emitted by the escrow contract
curl -s "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getEvents",
    "params": {
      "startLedger": <COMPROMISE_LEDGER>,
      "filters": [{
        "type": "contract",
        "contractIds": ["'"$CONTRACT_ESCROW"'"],
        "topics": [["*", "result"]]
      }]
    }
  }'
```

For each event, cross-reference with:
- The actual match outcome on Lichess/Chess.com using the `game_id`
- The on-chain payout destination

Flag any result where the recorded winner does not match the actual game outcome.

#### 3.4 For fraudulent results, call `override_result` during the dispute window

If any `submit_result` calls were fraudulent, override them before the dispute window expires:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- override_result \
  --match_id "$AFFECTED_MATCH_ID" \
  --correct_winner '{"Player1Wins":{}}' \
  --caller "$ADMIN_ADDRESS"
```

> ⚠️ **Time-sensitive:** `override_result` is only valid within the dispute window
> (`claim_timeout` ledgers after `submit_result` was called). Check the `pending_result_ledger`
> field on the affected match and act promptly.

Repeat for each fraudulent match result identified in §3.3.

#### 3.5 Unpause the contract

Only unpause after:

- [ ] New oracle key is registered and the oracle service is running with it
- [ ] All fraudulent results have been overridden
- [ ] All affected players have been notified and refunds confirmed where applicable
- [ ] A second team member has reviewed the audit findings

See [§5 Unpausing the Contract](#5-unpausing-the-contract) for the unpause command and checklist.

#### 3.6 Destroy and revoke the old key

- Delete the key from all `.env` files, CI secrets, and cloud secret stores
- If using a hardware wallet, revoke the compromised signing slot
- Document the compromise in the incident log and open a post-incident report (see §6)

---

## 4. Emergency Fund Drain

**When to use:** Active exploit with no time for match-by-match resolution. Transfers the
entire contract token balance to a safe cold-wallet address.

> ⚠️ **This is irreversible.** All in-progress matches will lose their escrowed funds.
> Use only when the alternative is losing more funds to an exploit.

### Prerequisites

- Contract must be **paused** (see §1).
- A **safe cold-wallet address** (`SAFE_ADDRESS`) that is NOT the admin hot wallet.

### Steps

#### 4.1 Confirm the contract is paused (see §1.3)

#### 4.2 Execute the drain

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- emergency_drain \
  --to "$SAFE_ADDRESS" \
  --caller "$ADMIN_ADDRESS"
```

#### 4.3 Confirm balance is zero

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source any-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_escrow_balance \
  --match_id 0
# Should return 0 for all match IDs
```

Check the contract's raw token balance:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$TOKEN_ADDRESS" \
  --source any-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- balance \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW"
# Expected: 0
```

#### 4.4 Record the drain transaction hash and notify all stakeholders

---

## 5. Unpausing the Contract

Only unpause after the incident is fully resolved and the root cause has been addressed.

### Checklist before unpausing

- [ ] Root cause identified and fixed (contract upgrade or oracle key rotated)
- [ ] All affected matches manually reconciled (refunds issued if needed)
- [ ] At least one other team member has reviewed and signed off
- [ ] Incident report drafted (see §5)

### Command

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source admin-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- unpause
```

### Verify

```bash
# Should succeed and return a match_id
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source player1-key \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_match \
  --player1 "$PLAYER1_ADDRESS" \
  --player2 "$PLAYER2_ADDRESS" \
  --stake_amount 10000000 \
  --token "$TOKEN_ADDRESS" \
  --game_id "post-incident-verify" \
  --platform '{"Lichess":{}}'
```
